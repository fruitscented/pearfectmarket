ongoing project

The idea is to create an application where small business owners and event holders can see and search for upcoming events that need vendors. Currently, users can filter through tags related to the event to find one right for them. There is also a submission that currently only goes to the admin because users face the issue of scammers. Having only submissions to the admin allows admin to verify posts before publishing them.
